    <p>To prepare Sindhi Biryani, start by cooking basmati rice until it's about 70-80% done. Drain and set aside.

        In a separate pot, heat oil and fry sliced onions until golden brown. Add garlic, ginger paste, and chopped
        tomatoes. Cook until tomatoes are softened.

        Add marinated chicken or mutton pieces along with Sindhi biryani masala (a blend of spices like cumin,
        coriander, turmeric, red chili powder). Cook until the meat is tender.

        Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture. Sprinkle with fried onions, chopped mint leaves, and
        cilantro. Drizzle saffron milk over the top for added flavor and color.

        Cover and cook on low heat until the rice is fully cooked and aromatic. Serve hot with raita and salad.</p>
