    <p>To make Beef Pulao, start by washing and soaking basmati rice for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.

        In a large pot, heat oil or ghee and fry sliced onions until golden brown. Add garlic paste, ginger paste, and
        whole spices like cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom pods. Saut√© until fragrant.

        Add cubed beef pieces and brown them slightly. Then, add yogurt, salt, red chili powder, and a pinch of turmeric
        powder. Cook until the beef is partially cooked.

        Add enough water or beef broth to cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until
        the beef is tender.

        Add the soaked rice to the pot and gently mix with the meat and spices. Adjust seasoning if needed. Cover the
        pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat until the rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed.

        Garnish with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves. Serve hot with raita or salad on the side.</p>
