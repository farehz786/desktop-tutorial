    <p>To make Beef Bihari Boti, start by marinating boneless Beef pieces in a mixture of yogurt, raw papaya
        paste, ginger paste, garlic paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let the Beef
        marinate for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.

        Next, skewer the marinated Beef pieces and grill them until cooked through and slightly charred.

        Serve hot with naan or paratha and a side of green chutney or raita. Garnish with freshly chopped coriander
        leaves and lemon wedges for extra freshness.</p>
